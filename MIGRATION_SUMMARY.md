# Migration to Cosmos DB - Summary

## What Was Done

Your SeedExchange API has been successfully updated to use Azure Cosmos DB! ðŸŽ‰

### Changes Overview

The application now **automatically uses Cosmos DB** when the appropriate environment variables are configured. Here's what was implemented:

#### 1. Automatic Storage Selection
- Created a new `initializeCollections()` factory function that:
  - Automatically detects if Cosmos DB credentials are available
  - Uses Cosmos DB when configured
  - Falls back to in-memory storage if not configured
  - Provides clear console messages about which storage is being used

#### 2. Updated Code
- **`src/collectionsFactory.ts`**: New factory function for automatic storage selection
- **`src/example.ts`**: Updated to use the new factory function
- **`src/index.ts`**: Exported new factory functions
- **Test coverage**: Added unit tests for the factory function (all 54 tests pass âœ…)

#### 3. Documentation
- **`README.md`**: Updated with automatic storage selection examples
- **`SETUP_COSMOS_DB.md`**: Comprehensive setup guide for different environments
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**: Updated to optionally test with Cosmos DB

#### 4. Backward Compatibility
- âœ… All existing tests pass
- âœ… In-memory collections still work exactly as before
- âœ… No breaking changes to the API
- âœ… Original singleton `collections` export remains available

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Set Up Azure Key Vault (Recommended)

For production security, store your Cosmos DB key in Azure Key Vault:

1. **Create a Key Vault** (if not already created):
   ```bash
   az keyvault create --name your-keyvault --resource-group your-resource-group --location eastus
   ```

2. **Get your Cosmos DB credentials**:
   - Go to Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
   - Navigate to your Cosmos DB account
   - Click on "Keys" in the left menu
   - Copy the **URI** (this is your `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`)
   - Copy the **PRIMARY KEY**

3. **Store the key in Key Vault**:
   ```bash
   az keyvault secret set --vault-name your-keyvault --name CosmosDbKey --value "your-primary-key"
   ```

4. **Grant access** to your application (if using managed identity):
   ```bash
   az keyvault set-policy --name your-keyvault --object-id <your-managed-identity-id> --secret-permissions get
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

**Option A: Using Azure Key Vault (Production)**

Set these environment variables:
```bash
export COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT="https://your-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
export AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI="https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/"
```

**Option B: Using Environment Variable (Development Only)**

For local testing only:
```bash
export COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT="https://your-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
export COSMOS_DB_KEY="your-cosmos-db-key"
```

**Note:** For production and GitHub Actions, always use Azure Key Vault.

### Step 3: Test Locally (Optional)

To test on your local machine:

```bash
# If using Key Vault, login to Azure first
az login

# Set environment variables
export COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT="https://your-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
export AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI="https://your-keyvault.vault.azure.net/"

# Build and run the example
npm run build
node dist/example.js
```

You should see:
```
Initializing Cosmos DB collections...
âœ“ Retrieved Cosmos DB key from Azure Key Vault
âœ“ Cosmos DB collections initialized successfully
```

### Step 4: Update GitHub Actions (If Using Key Vault)

If you want to use Key Vault in CI/CD:

1. Set up Azure OIDC authentication in your GitHub workflow
2. Add these secrets to GitHub:
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
   - `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`
   - `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI`

See SETUP_COSMOS_DB.md for detailed instructions.

Alternatively, you can continue using `COSMOS_DB_KEY` as a GitHub Secret for development/testing purposes.

### Step 4: Verify in CI/CD

When you merge this PR, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Run all tests (with in-memory storage)
- If secrets are configured, also test with real Cosmos DB

## How It Works Now

### For Developers Using Your API

They can now use your API with automatic storage selection:

```typescript
import { initializeCollections, SubmitSeedOffer } from 'seed-exchange-api';

// Automatically uses Cosmos DB when configured
// Retrieves key from Azure Key Vault if AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI is set
// Falls back to COSMOS_DB_KEY environment variable if Key Vault is not configured
const collections = await initializeCollections();

const user = {
  userId: 'user-123',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe'
};

// Same API as before, but now persisting to Cosmos DB!
const result = await SubmitSeedOffer(user, 'tomato-123', 5, collections);
console.log('Offer created:', result);
```

### Environment Detection

The app automatically detects which storage to use:

- **Cosmos DB with Key Vault**: When `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI` are set (recommended)
- **Cosmos DB with Environment Variable**: When `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_DB_KEY` are set (development only)
- **In-Memory**: When Cosmos DB credentials are not available (useful for testing/development)

### Graceful Fallback

If Cosmos DB connection or Key Vault access fails for any reason, the app automatically falls back to in-memory storage, ensuring your application continues to work.

## What Data You Need

The Cosmos DB integration is now complete. Here's what you need:

**Required:**
1. **`COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`**: Your Cosmos DB account endpoint (URI from Azure Portal)

**For Production (Recommended):**
2. **`AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URI`**: Your Azure Key Vault URI
3. **Cosmos DB Key stored in Key Vault** as a secret named "CosmosDbKey"

**For Development/Testing:**
2. **`COSMOS_DB_KEY`**: Your Cosmos DB account key (Primary or Secondary Key from Azure Portal)

That's it! The database and container will be automatically created when the app first connects.

### Cosmos DB Structure

The app will automatically create:
- **Database**: `SeedExchange` (or custom via `COSMOS_DB_DATABASE_ID` env var)
- **Container**: `SeedExchanges` (or custom via `COSMOS_DB_CONTAINER_ID` env var)
- **Partition Key**: `plantId` (optimized for plant-based queries)

## Testing the Implementation

### Run the Example

```bash
npm run build
node dist/example.js
```

This will demonstrate:
- Offering seeds
- Requesting seeds
- Automatic matching (FIFO order)
- Withdrawing requests
- All persisted to Cosmos DB!

### Run the Cosmos DB Example

For a more detailed demo with Cosmos DB-specific features:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cosmosDbExample.js
```

This example demonstrates the full lifecycle with Cosmos DB persistence, including initialization and connection feedback.

## Troubleshooting

### If You See "Using in-memory collections..."

This means Cosmos DB credentials are not set. Check:
1. Environment variables are set correctly
2. Variable names are exactly: `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_DB_KEY`
3. No typos in the values

### If Connection Fails

If you see "Failed to initialize Cosmos DB collections":
1. Verify your endpoint and key are correct
2. Check if your IP is allowed in Cosmos DB firewall
3. Ensure the key has read/write permissions

The app will automatically fall back to in-memory storage in this case.
