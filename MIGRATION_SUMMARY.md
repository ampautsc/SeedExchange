# Migration to Cosmos DB - Summary

## What Was Done

Your SeedExchange API has been successfully updated to use Azure Cosmos DB! ðŸŽ‰

### Changes Overview

The application now **automatically uses Cosmos DB** when the appropriate environment variables are configured. Here's what was implemented:

#### 1. Automatic Storage Selection
- Created a new `initializeCollections()` factory function that:
  - Automatically detects if Cosmos DB credentials are available
  - Uses Cosmos DB when configured
  - Falls back to in-memory storage if not configured
  - Provides clear console messages about which storage is being used

#### 2. Updated Code
- **`src/collectionsFactory.ts`**: New factory function for automatic storage selection
- **`src/example.ts`**: Updated to use the new factory function
- **`src/index.ts`**: Exported new factory functions
- **Test coverage**: Added unit tests for the factory function (all 54 tests pass âœ…)

#### 3. Documentation
- **`README.md`**: Updated with automatic storage selection examples
- **`SETUP_COSMOS_DB.md`**: Comprehensive setup guide for different environments
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`**: Updated to optionally test with Cosmos DB

#### 4. Backward Compatibility
- âœ… All existing tests pass
- âœ… In-memory collections still work exactly as before
- âœ… No breaking changes to the API
- âœ… Original singleton `collections` export remains available

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Your Cosmos DB Credentials

If you haven't already, you need your Cosmos DB endpoint and key:

1. Go to Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
2. Navigate to your Cosmos DB account
3. Click on "Keys" in the left menu
4. Copy:
   - **URI** (this is your `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`)
   - **PRIMARY KEY** (this is your `COSMOS_DB_KEY`)

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

You mentioned you've already added the secrets - great! Just make sure they're named correctly:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/ampautsc/SeedExchange
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
3. Verify you have these secrets:
   - `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` - Your Cosmos DB endpoint URL
   - `COSMOS_DB_KEY` - Your Cosmos DB key

**Important**: The secret names must be exactly as shown above (case-sensitive).

### Step 3: Test Locally (Optional)

To test on your local machine:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT="https://your-account.documents.azure.com:443/"
export COSMOS_DB_KEY="your-cosmos-db-key"

# Build and run the example
npm run build
node dist/example.js
```

You should see:
```
Initializing Cosmos DB collections...
âœ“ Cosmos DB collections initialized successfully
```

### Step 4: Verify in CI/CD

When you merge this PR, the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Run all tests (with in-memory storage)
- If secrets are configured, also test with real Cosmos DB

## How It Works Now

### For Developers Using Your API

They can now use your API with automatic storage selection:

```typescript
import { initializeCollections, SubmitSeedOffer } from 'seed-exchange-api';

// Automatically uses Cosmos DB if COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT and COSMOS_DB_KEY are set
const collections = await initializeCollections();

const user = {
  userId: 'user-123',
  email: 'user@example.com',
  name: 'John Doe'
};

// Same API as before, but now persisting to Cosmos DB!
const result = await SubmitSeedOffer(user, 'tomato-123', 5, collections);
console.log('Offer created:', result);
```

### Environment Detection

The app automatically detects which storage to use:

- **Cosmos DB**: When both `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_DB_KEY` environment variables are set
- **In-Memory**: When credentials are not available (useful for testing/development)

### Graceful Fallback

If Cosmos DB connection fails for any reason, the app automatically falls back to in-memory storage, ensuring your application continues to work.

## What Data You Need

You asked "let me know what data you need" - the Cosmos DB integration is now complete and only needs these two pieces of information:

1. **`COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT`**: Your Cosmos DB account endpoint (URI from Azure Portal)
2. **`COSMOS_DB_KEY`**: Your Cosmos DB account key (Primary or Secondary Key from Azure Portal)

That's it! The database and container will be automatically created when the app first connects.

### Cosmos DB Structure

The app will automatically create:
- **Database**: `SeedExchange` (or custom via `COSMOS_DB_DATABASE_ID` env var)
- **Container**: `SeedExchanges` (or custom via `COSMOS_DB_CONTAINER_ID` env var)
- **Partition Key**: `plantId` (optimized for plant-based queries)

## Testing the Implementation

### Run the Example

```bash
npm run build
node dist/example.js
```

This will demonstrate:
- Offering seeds
- Requesting seeds
- Automatic matching (FIFO order)
- Withdrawing requests
- All persisted to Cosmos DB!

### Run the Cosmos DB Example

For a more detailed demo:

```bash
node dist/cosmosDbExample.js
```

This shows the full lifecycle with Cosmos DB persistence.

## Troubleshooting

### If You See "Using in-memory collections..."

This means Cosmos DB credentials are not set. Check:
1. Environment variables are set correctly
2. Variable names are exactly: `COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_DB_KEY`
3. No typos in the values

### If Connection Fails

If you see "Failed to initialize Cosmos DB collections":
1. Verify your endpoint and key are correct
2. Check if your IP is allowed in Cosmos DB firewall
3. Ensure the key has read/write permissions

The app will automatically fall back to in-memory storage in this case.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… **Review this PR** - Check the changes look good
2. âœ… **Merge the PR** - Once you're satisfied with the implementation
3. ðŸ”„ **Test in production** - Deploy and verify Cosmos DB integration works
4. ðŸ“Š **Monitor usage** - Check Azure Portal for RU consumption and storage
